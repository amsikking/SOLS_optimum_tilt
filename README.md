# SOLS optimum* tilt - quadratic estimate
In a single-objective light-sheet (SOLS) style microscope the light-sheet consumes some of the numerical aperture (NA) from the emission path. i.e. more NA for the light-sheet gives better sectioning but less NA for collection. The trade of light-sheet vs emission NA is governed by the tilt of the 3rd microscope (theta_tilt). Some builders have used theta_tilt =30 degrees. So the question is... what is the optimal* tilt?

Here's a simple analytical estimate for matching the light-sheet thickness to the axial PSF.

(*depends on what you're trying to optimize!)
